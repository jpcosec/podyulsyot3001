## [2026-04-06] - Unified Automation Phase 2

### Added
- **Ariadne Semantic Layer**: Implemented `AriadnePortalMap`, `AriadneState`, `AriadneTask`, and `AriadnePath` models in `src/automation/ariadne/models.py`.
- **Crawl4AI Compiler**: New motor-specific compiler in `src/automation/motors/crawl4ai/compiler/` that translates Ariadne Paths into optimized C4A-Scripts.
- **Ariadne Navigator**: Added state-aware replay logic in `src/automation/ariadne/navigator.py` for handling portal deviations.
- **Ariadne Recorder**: Implemented session capture and raw trace persistence in `src/automation/ariadne/recorder.py`.
- **Capability Registry**: Documented motor-specific superpowers and intent mapping in `docs/automation/ariadne_capabilities.md`.
- **Standardized Storage**: Created `src/automation/storage.py` to decouple execution engines from the data plane.

### Changed
- **Unified CLI**: Refactored `src/automation/main.py` to use the new semantic maps and standardized storage.
- **Engine Refactor**: Migrated Crawl4AI and BrowserOS motors to consume unified JSON maps instead of motor-specific Python adapters.
- **Documentation**: Standardized `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` to follow mandatory project guidelines.

### Fixed
- Restored **Dry-Run** functionality in the Crawl4AI engine.
- Fixed closure bug in `_check_state_presence`.
- Re-implemented **File Upload** hooks for semantic paths.
- Standardized error handling with specific `AriadneError` exceptions and screenshot capture on failure.

### Removed
- Deprecated `src/automation/ariadne/portal_models.py` and its associated Phase 1 models.
- Removed dead Python-based portal definitions in `src/automation/portals/`.
- Cleaned up legacy `BrowserOSPlaybook` models and traces.
